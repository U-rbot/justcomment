To achieve the desired result in Excel, you can use a combination of functions such as `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `IF`. Let's assume your "Req Number" column is in column A and the "Data Status" column is in column B. You can follow these steps:

1. In an empty column, let's say column C (starting from C2), enter the following formula to calculate the count of "Not Found" for each "Req Number":

```
=SUMIFS($B$2:$B$100, $A$2:$A$100, A2, $B$2:$B$100, "not found")
```

2. In another empty column, let's say column D (starting from D2), enter the following formula to check if a "Req Number" has only "Not Found" entries:

```
=IF(COUNTIFS($A$2:$A$100, A2, $B$2:$B$100, "not found")=COUNTIFS($A$2:$A$100, A2), "Not Found", "Found")
```

3. Now, you will have a new column (column D) displaying "Not Found" or "Found" for each "Req Number" based on your criteria.

4. If you want to get the unique "Req Numbers" that have "Not Found" status, you can use the "Remove Duplicates" feature in Excel.

Here's how you can do that:

- Select the range containing the "Req Numbers" and the "Not Found/Found" status (columns A and D).
- Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon.
- Click on "Remove Duplicates" in the "Data Tools" group.
- A dialog box will appear, and you can choose to remove duplicates based on the "Req Numbers" (column A) and click "OK."

Now, you'll have a list of unique "Req Numbers" with "Not Found" status only.

Please note that this approach assumes that the "Req Numbers" in column A have consistent formatting and do not contain leading/trailing spaces. If there are any variations, you may need to adjust the formulas accordingly.
